Project made with HTML5 and CSS3 by youtube.com/watch?v=PuyZAUyZYDI

This is my first front-end project. It's a website containing informations of an IT event, where people are talking about the IT world and selling their products and projects.

The functionalities of this project are not done because Javascript wasn't used. It's just for exposition.

It was made with HTML5 and CSS3.

You can run it by your browser. Just open the index.html file.

In the future, the plans are continuing this project with Javascript to add functionalities, like send an e-mail when you click on the submit bottom. So, this project isn't done.
